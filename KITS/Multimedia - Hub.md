# Training Kit: Multimedia - Hub

![](../assets/kits/Multimedia-Hub-1.jpg)

## Description

This powerful Training Kit is designed to serve multiply digital literacy trainings as well as setting up a running multimedia center with open source software and a simple Raspberry Pi. This can run local media resources (primary Video, Audio, Images, can be extended with add-ons) but also setup for external internet radio, TV, Podcasting and other streaming media to play from. This can also for advanced users run a small internet Radio station (needs investigation).

## Modules included

**Modules (Layer 1-4)**

- Module [M007](../MODULES/M007.md): Media Controls
- Module [M008](../MODULES/M008.md): Media Center
- Module [M009](../MODULES/M009.md): Audio Extras
- Module [M010](../MODULES/M010.md): Media Accessories

## Assembly Notes

For the Setup, please also follow the [Software](../Software/README.md) instructions.


The Kit is assembled in a way, one can attach the modules together with hook-and-loop parts so each module can be fixed to each other or to the lid (though the controls/screen module makes most sense on top). It Unfolds for easy (un)packing.

For the Setup Use-Case make sure to connect all devices to power and power the screen and RPi separately if possible to avoid power shortage. If needed connect the "Audio Extras".

> When using the DAC HAT (recommended) for better quality audio (RPi5 has no specific audio output) and the NVMe SSD storage option for media data, make sure to connect all adapters properly:
