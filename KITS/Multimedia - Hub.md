## Assembly Notes

For the Setup, please also follow the [Software](../Software/README.md) instructions.


The Kit is assembled in a way, one can attach the modules together with hook-and-loop parts so each module can be fixed to each other or to the lid (though the controls/screen module makes most sense on top). It Unfolds for easy (un)packing.
